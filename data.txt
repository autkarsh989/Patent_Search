Systems and methods are provided for navigating an information hierarchy using a mobile communication device. The method comprises causing a plurality of selectable items to be presented on a display associated with the mobile communication device, in response to receiving, via an audio input device associated with the mobile communication device, a first voice command indicating that one of the plurality of selectable items is to be selected, causing one of the selectable items in the plurality of selectable items to be displayed differently from the other selectable items to thereby form an accentuated selectable item, and, in response to receiving, via the audio input device, a second voice command indicating that the accentuated selectable item is to be selected, causing information associated with the accentuated selectable item to be presented on the display.

A method for safe and efficient use of airport runway capacity includes receiving, at an air traffic control system at an airport, airport data related to movement areas of the airport, time data related to a time period, aircraft data related to a plurality of aircraft expected to operate into and out of the airport during the time period, and environmental data related to environmental conditions predicted for the airport during the time period. The method further includes computing a probability distribution for inter-aircraft spacing by applying the airport data, the time data, the aircraft data, and the environmental data to a trained Bayesian network, producing the probability distribution for the inter-aircraft spacing as an output observation of the trained Bayesian network, and, using the probability distribution and a confidence value, identifying an inter-aircraft spacing value for the plurality of aircraft expected to operate into and out of the airport during the time period.

Methods and systems for managing advertisement (ad) delivery and ad inventory for advertisements (ads) placed in video content are provided. An exemplary method receives campaign criteria for a new advertising campaign, the campaign criteria including at least a desired date range. The method then retrieves indications of unsold ad space inventory. In response to determining, based at least in part on the unsold ad space inventory in the desired date range, that the campaign criteria cannot be satisfied, the method: renders, in a user interface, an interactive ad delivery and distribution report indicating forecasted ad distribution and ad delivery for at least part of the desired date range during which the campaign criteria cannot be satisfied; and redistributes ad delivery by adjusting an ad delivery plan based on adjusted report parameters received via the interface in order to accommodate the new advertising campaign.

One method performed by a computer stores data, receives voice data, and annotates the stored data based on the voice data. Another method stores a plurality of files in memory, determines that the memory has reached a threshold capacity, selects one or more files for remote storage in response to the memory reaching the threshold capacity, and wirelessly transmits the selected one or more files to a remote storage device. Another method audibly presents an advertisement by a mobile device, receives an input at the mobile device, and presents the advertisement again by the mobile device in response to receiving the input.

The invention is a thin, light, touch sensitive, typically portable keyboard for an electronic device, which uses walls between most adjacent keys to prevent one finger activating more than intended key. This enables packing keys extremely close to each other, yet negligible chance of false activation. Round, hexagonal or wave shaped walls enable more keys for same working surface area, compared to square keys. Variations are detachable, externals, removable walls formed by a layer over the keyboard. Sizes can be from wrist worn watch like, credit card, cell phone, pocket and more. Foldable versions enable more keys for less stowage space.

Systems and methods for distinguishing between a gesture tracing out a word and a wiping motion on a touch-sensitive keyboard are disclosed herein. In one aspect, a method includes: displaying a plurality of keys on the touch-sensitive keyboard. The method also includes: detecting a contact at the plurality of keys, followed by a sliding movement of the contact. The method also includes: automatically determining whether the user is tracing out a word. In accordance with a determination that the user is tracing out a word, the method includes: displaying one or more characters. In accordance with a determination that the sliding movement corresponds to a wiping motion, forgoing display of characters contacted during the sliding movement of the contact. The wiping motion includes an input that simultaneously contacts multiple keys and moves as the input remains in contact with multiple keys.

The present invention relates to an extended-function device for selectively retrieving information in response to naturally spoken commands provided via an electronic-communication device of a user that is used to query a corresponding descriptor file that identifies a web-accessible information source and fetches responsive data specified by select data identified by the accessed descriptor file. An audio response data containing indicia of a message for the user, which message is responsive to the identified naturally spoken command, and based on the responsive data is directed to the electronic-communication device of the user.

This invention relates to an advertisement machine which provides advertisements to a user searching for desired information within a data network. The machine receives, from a user, a search request including a search argument corresponding to the desired information and searches, based upon the received search argument, a first database having data network related information to generate search results. It also correlates the received search argument to a particular advertisement in a second database having advertisement related information. The search results together with the particular advertisement are provided by the machine to the user.
